# College Explorer Platform

This project proposes the development of "College Explorer," a web-based platform similar to LinkedIn, designed specifically for college students. College Explorer facilitates project sharing, fostering, collaboration, and knowledge exchange. Students can upload project code, execution videos, and certificates. A "like" button allows users to express appreciation, while a "comment" section enables discussions and troubleshooting. College Explorer fosters a vibrant learning community where students learn from each other's work.
